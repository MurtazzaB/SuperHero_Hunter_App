# SuperHero_Hunter_App
 This project is Super Hero Hunter App in which we use Marvel's Superhero API to fetch the records and details of all the superheroes along with some additional features. It is built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript.
Superhero Hunter App is created for showing all Powers & Abilities of the Super-Heros. We can check more details of superheros by clicking on it and we can add and remove the Suoerhero from our Favourite List.
